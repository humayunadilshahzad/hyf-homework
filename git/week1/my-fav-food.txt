Ras malai
Ingredients
Ras malai consists of white, cream, or yellow coloured flattened balls of chhana soaked in malai (clotted cream) flavoured with cardamom. The balls are cooked in sugar syrup and milk with saffron, pistachios and kheer as stuffing.[5][better source needed] Homemade ras malai is usually made from powdered milk, all-purpose flour, baking powder and oil, which are kneaded to form a dough, moulded into balls, and dropped into simmering milk cream.
