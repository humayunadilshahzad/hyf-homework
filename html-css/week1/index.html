            </header>
            <p>I am someone who is consistently growing themselves and who takes the
                time to continue learning even though it's not a direct
                requirement of the job. I find that many times it's a combination of what you study both directly
                and
                indirectly related to work.Someone who thinks positively and who can execute on difficult tasks.
                I'm not an individual who needs to be micro-managed. Rather, when given a specific task, I can
                figure
                out the best ways to solve the problem in an autonomous manner.</p>
            <p>I have a need to produce results. I am the type of person to meet challenges head-on rather than
                sweep
                them under the rug and hope they go away. While I'm an optimistic person, I am
                also realistic about the current situation and how satisfactory or unsatisfactory it is.</p>

                <p>HackYourFuture is a code school (foundation) teaching computer programming to refugees. Our aim
                    is
                    to empower our students through coding and get them to work as software developers. With 40
                    developers (all volunteers) we have created a 6-month program in which our students learn the
                    fundamentals
                    of web-development. After graduation we guide our students towards employment via our network.
                    Besides learning our students how to code, we also teach them how to work on projects in a
                    modern
                    tech team.
                    We teach every Sunday in Amsterdam, during the week we coach and support our students online
                    with
                    their homework. Throughout our course our students have multiple business visits, masterclasses
                    from various tech experts, and get individual coaching in their career.</p>
